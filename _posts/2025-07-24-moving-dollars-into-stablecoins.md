# Moving dollars into stablecoin

I've never been a crypto guy. The amount of hype around crypto has always driven me nuts.

But...stablecoins are starting to become interesting. Maybe this is my rabbit hole into crypto? We'll see.

The first thing I want to try is just having a wallet with some stablecoins in it. I don't want to have to deal with a hardware wallet. I want to turn real dollars into magical stablecoins in the cloud. Then I want to try sending the magical stablecoins around the cloud and getting them back out into real physical dollars.

But first I need a wallet. In crypto parlance I want to start with a "non-custodial" wallet. I don't want to handle the private keys. In fact I want to know as little about blockchain as possible. I _do_ know how blockchains work, but I'm pretending to be a simpleton consumer to see how many rough edges there still are with all of this. After all, traditional bank accounts are non-custodial. You deposit some money and see a number go up on some website.

## Funding a wallet with USDC

OK, so Coinbase is a leading stablecoin provider. I went there and signed up for an "individual" account. It asked me some (probably marketing) questions and had me do a pretty simple KYC flow where I took a picture of the front and back of my drivers license right there in the browser.

And voila, in a matter of minutes I had an account on Coinbase.

Next I need to get some money into my account. OK, let's add funds from my bank.

Hey, look at that, Plaid pops up. Using my phone number, Plaid shows me that it already knows how to connect to my bank accounts. I must have used Plaid on some other web sites. At this point I started to feel a little unsettled, like I was crossing a point of no return into cryptoland and I was bringing a trail with me that could be followed back to my traditional bank accounts. Oh well. I connected my checking account.

Now I can "buy crypto". Ugh. That's a button I never thought I would click on purpose.

I don't really want to "buy crypto", I want to turn dollars into USDC. But whatever. I guess that's saying the same thing. Let's do this.

Other than a mysterious 4.10% "earning rate" &mdash; I thought I was turning dollars into USDC, not funding a high-yield savings account? &mdash; and a forboding _Crypto markets are unique_ warning, I was able to turn 10 USD into 10 USDC without any fees.

And with that, Coinbase tells me I have $10 of USDC in my account. Strangely, it puts USDC assets under the "Cash" tab, not "Crypto". I thought I just bought crypto?

## So many questions

Is stablecoin crypto?

Or, is stablecoin cash?

Is it kind of both?

Am I now a crypto bro?

Do I actually earn 4.10% on my USDC? That's actually a pretty good rate, but as of today my regular, non-crypto high-interest savings account earns a slightly higher rate of 4.20%. Oh, and it's insured by the FDIC. Something tells me my Coinbase account is not. (_Crypto markets are unique_)

I have so many questions, but this was a fun foray into cryptoland.
