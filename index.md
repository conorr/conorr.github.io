My name is Conor T. Ryan, and I am a software developer from Seattle, Washington, USA.

I currently work at financial technology company [Remitly](https://www.remitly.com/).

Though in my day job I specialize in distributed systems, I am a jack-of-all-trades who enjoys learning across disciplines.

This blog is my way of practicing [beginner's mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin). I like to take the approach of "learning in public" where I follow my curiosity about some subject and share what I learn along the way.
